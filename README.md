SystemForAreaPlanning
=====================

This project was undertaken as my bachelor final project. The idea behind this project was to allow architectures to plan the city as much efficiently as possible. This project is related to solving 2D packing problem, which is considered to be NP-Hard. Moreover, the optimisation performed of this problem tries to solve 2D knapsack problem. Nevertheless, I did not managed to solve this problem due to its complexity and my optimisation still runs in exponential time if you want to achieve the best result. Is it possible to implement heuristic solutions that would allow to tackle the problem in linear time, however effieciency will be lost. 

This project might become active again if I will find spare time to do it, because I strongly believe that the optimisation can be improved and 2D problem might be tackled.

If you are intrested in this project I can provide you with my dissertation paper about the research that was undertaken.
